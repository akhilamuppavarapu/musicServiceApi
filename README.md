# Music Service API
Implement a RESTful API in C# (.NET 5) that satisfies a variety of CRUD and/or CRUD-type operations for a fictitious music service.

-> The API should provide interfaces for manipulating music-related data such as song information, artists, playlists, unique listens and play counts, etc.

-> Include basic logging via IoC/dependency injection.

-> Ensure that all content returned from your controllers is JSON.

-> Be sure to generate sample data and test all endpoints.

Additionally, bonus points will be awarded for utilizing MongoDB and its related libraries (or any NoSQL database) for data storage and retrieval.

Include postman; if you are also a fan, feel free to export and include your collections/requests.
